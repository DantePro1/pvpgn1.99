					  <strong>What is PvPGN?</strong>
					</p>
					<blockquote>
					  <p class="text13">PvPGN (Player vs Player Gaming Network) is a bnetd based gaming network server emulation project. It currently supports all Battle.net games (such as StarCraft, Diablo II, and Warcraft III), and most Westwood Online clients (Tiberian Sun, Red Alert 2, Yuri's Revenge). It gives you the power to run your own server, manage your own users, run your own tournaments, etc.</p>
					  <p class="text13">Some common uses of a PvPGN server:</p>
						<ul>
						  <li class="text13">When wanting to have a small community with local users and small ladders (lots of internet cafes do that)</li>
						  <li class="text13">For people who want to play on a LAN but with Battle.net-like statistics</li>
						  <li class="text13">For people who find Battle.net too slow or laggy and want to play on a local server with no lag</li>
						</ul>
					  <p class="text13">It puts you as a &quot;System Administrator&quot; in control. Use a PvPGN server to host your own LAN parties or put the server online and on the internet for everyone. You can run tournaments, have your own local competition ladders. The power is in your hands.</p>
